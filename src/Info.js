        The history of women's football has seen major competitions being
        launched, but it's players have faced many struggles over the decades.
        Although its first golden age occurred in the United Kingdom in the
        early 1920s, with matches attracting large crowds, the Football
        Association initiated a ban in 1921 that disallowed women's football
        games from taking place on the grounds used by its member clubs. This
        ban remained in effect until July 1971. (Adapted from Wikipedia)
